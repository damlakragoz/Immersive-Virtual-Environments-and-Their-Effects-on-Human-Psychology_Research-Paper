This research paper explores immersive technologies and their applications in psychology with the exigency of providing an extensive understanding of immersive technologies, extended realities and their connection with human psychology. The main focus is on Virtual Reality (VR) as it is currently the most advanced immersive technology. 

Immersive technologies are computer systems that create alternative realities by merging the human participant’s physical surroundings and a digital reality created through visuals while imposing a sense of telepresence in this alternative reality on the participant. 

Previous studies have shown that VR has useful applications in psychology including many forms of treatments, clinical assessments and usages in academic studies. However, there are not many studies regarding the negative consequences virtual reality exposure on human psychology. The central question of this paper is if immersive technologies' usage in psychology a beneficial practice, considering their limitations and drawbacks. 

#### By analysing previous researches and valuable data, we report that while the long-term effects of virtual reality on our mental health are still a subject that requires heavy research and even though its unrestricted usage might cause symptoms such as derealization, depersonalization, isolation and addiction, with professional usage and supervision VR holds immense potential in psychology. Despite the risks, VR’s immense value and potential cannot be overlooked. However, it is very crucial that professionals do not undermine and fully recognize the possible risks of VR exposure. Medical professionals must be acquainted with both the possibilities and challenges these technologies will present to professional practice and take precautions to minimize the challenges to ensure their appropriate development and utilization in the psychology field.
